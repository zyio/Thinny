After almost a year, I'm releasing Thinny 2.2, with great improvements from the last stable version.

This version includes:

- A redesigned menu;

- A new share menu for desktops;

- A rewritten stylesheet, using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com);

- Integration with some APIs ([Cards](https://cards.twitter.com), [Theme-Color](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2014/11/Support-for-theme-color-in-Chrome-39-for-Android) and [Transparency](https:/api.yandex.com/transparency/));

- Lots of bug fixes (thanks to all of you making pull requests!).

As a downside, the Parallax effect was causing some troubles, so it's now disabled by default. But you can still use it by setting the `parallax` variable to `true`. I'll try to redo it for 2.3, and I'd appreciate [your help](https://github.com/camporez/Thinny/tree/dev).

Now, let's take a look at some things you need to know for writing beautiful posts on Thinny... I hope you enjoy it!

# Using Thinny

## Global variables

Global variables are set on the `_config.yml` file.

They are responsible for the site configuration, for the common settings in all pages (like the menu items and the social links), and for the default values for some variables.

### Menu

Inside the `menu` variable you can put all the links you want to display on the menu.

For each entry you'll have to declare the `title` and the `url`. Example:

~~~
menu:
  title:        Portfolio
  url:          /portfolio
~~~

The "Home" entry isn't displayed on desktops.

### Social links

The social icons are provided by [Genericons](http://genericons.com/). Each entry has an `icon` (you can see all the icons on [the Genericons website](http://genericons.com/)), a `url` and a description (`desc`).

~~~
social:
  - icon:         reddit
    url:          https://reddit.com/r/jekyll
    desc:         Subscribe on reddit
~~~

### Comments

To enable comments, you have to set the `commentsystem` variable to either `disqus` or `google`.

If you choose Disqus, you'll need to set your username inside the variable `disqus`.

## Page variables

The page variables are set on the beginning of every post or page. Some of then are required, but others are optional.

### Title and quote

The `title` variable sets a title for your post, and it's required.

The `quote` variable is optional. It must be a small (about the size of a tweet) subtitle for your post.

### Post cover

On the top of your post, a full width and height image or video will be displayed. This image should be related to your post, and if no image/video is set the default cover in `_config.yml` will be used.

You can use just an image, or also include a video (if on mobile, or if the browse don't have video support, the image will be displayed instead).

You can also include a URL pointing to the source of the cover image/video, this will add a small icon on the bottom right of the cover image. Clicking this icon will open the source link in a new tab.

The video should be at least in one of the three available formats (mp4, webm and ogv), but using two of them is recommended.

This is how the `image` and `video` variables should look like:

~~~
image:
   url: [URL]
   source: [source URL]
video:
   mp4: [mp4 URL] 
   webm: [webm URL]
   ogv: [ogv URL]
~~~

All of this is optional.

### Colors

Each post can use a different color for its links, and if no `color` variable is set the default one in `_config.yml` will be used.

This color will also be used [on Android Lollipop](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2014/11/Support-for-theme-color-in-Chrome-39-for-Android), and as page cover when no image or video is set (if no color, image or video, the default site cover is used).

~~~
color: "00b5f5"
~~~

{% include image.html url="/media/2015-02-10-a-quick-look-into-thinny-22/lollipop.jpg" description="Colorful toolbar on Android Lollipop's Chrome." %}

### Dark color scheme

The default color for the items above the post's cover can be changed for grey. This is useful in case your cover image has a light look, making it hard to read the text.

~~~
dark: true
~~~

![Dark theme](/media/2015-02-10-a-quick-look-into-thinny-22/dark.jpg)

### Comments

Comments can be enabled/disabled per post, all you have to do is set the `comments` variable to `true` or `false`:

~~~
comments: false
~~~
